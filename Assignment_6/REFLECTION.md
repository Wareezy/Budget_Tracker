## Reflection on Prioritization, Estimation, and Agile Alignment

Working through the Agile planning process for my Budget Tracker project revealed several internal challenges, especially since I was both the product owner and the primary stakeholder.

### Prioritization Challenges
One of the biggest hurdles was prioritization. While drafting the user stories and mapping them to MoSCoW priorities, I found it difficult to distinguish between what was genuinely **“Must-have”** versus features that could be delayed. The desire to deliver a polished product from the start created internal resistance to leaving anything out of the MVP.

For instance, while generating financial reports and recurring transactions were classified as *"Should-have"*, part of me felt these were essential since they contribute heavily to user satisfaction. However, forcing myself to stick to Agile principles meant focusing on core functionalities that deliver the highest value early—transaction logging, categorization, real-time balance updates, and security.

### Estimation Challenges
Estimation presented its own set of challenges. Without real-world user feedback or a team to consult, every task’s effort estimate was based on assumptions rather than concrete data. 

Estimating hours for tasks like API development or AES-256 encryption forced me to confront my own uncertainties about the complexity of implementation. For example, setting 12 hours for API endpoints felt like a balanced number, but deep down I questioned whether this might be underestimated due to potential debugging or integration issues.

The same applied to database query optimization and ensuring app responsiveness—technical debt and unforeseen edge cases could easily stretch those estimates. The internal conflict of wanting to be optimistic but fearing scope creep made estimation feel more like guesswork than a science.

### Aligning Agile with Internal Stakeholder Resistance
Another subtle challenge came from aligning Agile principles with my own stakeholder needs. As the project progressed, I struggled with perfectionism and a subconscious desire for immediate completeness. 

Agile’s iterative nature—where not everything is perfect or finished in the first sprint—felt counterintuitive. There were moments when pushing features like notifications or user preferences to later sprints felt like sacrificing quality or user experience. This internal resistance created tension, questioning whether the MVP would be truly *“viable”* without those enhancements.

However, reflecting on Agile’s core values reminded me that early feedback and adaptability matter more than launching a fully loaded product. Forcing myself to stick to the prioritized backlog helped build confidence that focusing on fewer but well-executed features would lead to better outcomes.

### Stakeholder Reflection
Lastly, being the only stakeholder made it difficult to validate decisions objectively. There was no external pressure, which at times reduced urgency and allowed procrastination to creep in—another form of internal resistance. 

Having to be both the driver and the critic slowed progress and created moments of self-doubt. Yet, this exercise in self-reflection strengthened my understanding of Agile’s flexibility and the importance of sticking to priorities even when personal biases lean toward over-delivery.
