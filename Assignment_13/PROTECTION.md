# 🔐 Branch Protection Rules for `main`

## ✅ Why These Rules Matter

Branch protection helps enforce quality control, team collaboration, and code safety. In this project, we’ve applied the following rules to the `main` branch:

### 1. Require Pull Request Reviews
- **Why:** Prevents unreviewed or potentially harmful code from being merged.
- **Impact:** At least one team member must review and approve changes before merging.

### 2. Require Status Checks to Pass
- **Why:** Ensures automated tests (via CI) pass before merging.
- **Impact:** Helps avoid breaking the main branch with failing or buggy code.

### 3. Disable Direct Pushes
- **Why:** Forces all changes to go through pull requests.
- **Impact:** Provides better traceability, accountability, and history clarity.

## 📘 Summary
These rules are essential for enforcing professional development practices like **code review**, **automated testing**, and **team collaboration** — reducing bugs and maintaining a stable production branch.
