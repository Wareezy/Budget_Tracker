### ðŸ§© Why I Customized My Team Planning Board Columns

When setting up my **Team Planning** board for the Budget Tracker project, I customized the default column layout to reflect a realistic, structured Agile workflow â€” even though Iâ€™m working as a solo developer. My current board layout is:

**"No Status" â†’ "To Do" â†’ "In Progress" â†’ "Blocked" â†’ "Testing" â†’ "Done"**

This specific order was chosen to mirror the natural flow of how work progresses in a real-world development environment. Each column represents a clear phase in the lifecycle of a task, making it easier to manage, prioritize, and reflect on progress at a glance.

#### ðŸ§ª Why I Added "Testing"

I added the **"Testing"** column to serve as a dedicated stage for quality assurance. Although Iâ€™m working independently, itâ€™s important that every feature is verified before being marked complete. This column acts as a checkpoint where I validate that:

- The feature works as expected
- Edge cases are handled properly
- No existing functionality has been broken

This encourages me to pause and thoroughly test features, rather than rushing from "In Progress" straight to "Done." It also makes it easier to identify and revisit features that may need refinement or improvement later on. Incorporating a "Testing" stage brings maturity to the process and helps establish good development habits that scale well in team environments.

#### â›” Why I Added "Blocked"

I also introduced a **"Blocked"** column to handle tasks that are temporarily stuck or waiting on something before they can continue. Common reasons for a task to be blocked might include:

- Unresolved bugs or technical issues
- Dependency on another feature being completed first
- Ambiguities that require a decision or redesign

This column allows me to clearly separate tasks I *want* to work on from those I *can* work on. It helps me stay focused by not wasting time on stalled items, while still tracking them for future action. Additionally, during sprint reviews or retrospectives, I can easily identify what types of blockers are recurring and look for ways to address them more efficiently.

#### ðŸ”€ Why I Organized the Columns in This Order

The order of the columns was intentionally chosen to follow the logical progression of a task from idea to completion, in a way that mirrors Agile and Scrum-based workflows:

- **"No Status"** is the default holding space for newly created issues that havenâ€™t yet been triaged or categorized. It acts as an inbox for raw tasks.
  
- **"To Do"** represents tasks that have been reviewed, prioritized, and are ready to be worked on. This column is essentially my sprint backlog.

- **"In Progress"** is where active development happens. Tasks move here once Iâ€™ve started working on them. This helps me maintain focus and manage WIP (Work In Progress).

- **"Blocked"** comes next because it reflects tasks that were in progress but canâ€™t move forward due to a dependency or issue. This placement keeps them close to the action and visible for quick resolution.

- **"Testing"** follows once a feature is built and ready to be verified. Placing it before "Done" ensures that I donâ€™t mark anything complete until itâ€™s been validated and reviewed for quality.

- **"Done"** is the final column. Only fully tested and completed tasks are moved here, ensuring theyâ€™ve passed all necessary stages and meet the definition of done.

This ordered structure makes the board easy to follow and helps me track tasks with clarity. It also ensures a **step-by-step development pipeline** that promotes both productivity and quality.

#### ðŸ§  Why This Structure Matters

By customizing my board to include **"Testing"** and **"Blocked"**, and by organizing the columns in a logical sequence, Iâ€™ve created a workflow that feels natural, efficient, and scalable. This structure helps me:

- Maintain a high standard of quality
- Avoid multitasking and distractions
- Quickly identify stalled or at-risk tasks
- Simulate a professional Agile development process

Even in a solo setting, this disciplined approach improves my project planning, time estimation, and task management. It also prepares me for collaboration in future team environments where such structured workflows are essential for success.
