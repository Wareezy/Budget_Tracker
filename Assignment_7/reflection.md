## 🎯 Reflection: Template Selection, Customization & Tool Comparison

### ⚙️ Challenges in Selecting & Customizing the Template

Choosing the right project management template wasn’t as straightforward as I expected. GitHub offers several templates — each tailored for different workflows like feature releases, bug tracking, and product launches. While they’re helpful, none felt like a perfect fit out of the box for how I wanted to manage my **Budget Tracker** project.

I eventually selected the **Team Planning** template because it supported backlogs, iterations, and task tracking — all things I needed. However, once I started building out the board, I realized some stages in my development cycle weren’t represented. 

That’s when I decided to customize the board by adding two essential columns:  
- **🧪 Testing** — for quality assurance before marking tasks as done  
- **⛔ Blocked** — to capture tasks that are paused due to blockers or dependencies  

Organizing the board into the flow:  
**`No Status → To Do → In Progress → Blocked → Testing → Done`**  
gave me a structured and visual pipeline that made more sense for both solo and Agile-based workflows. The main challenge here was balancing simplicity with process accuracy — enough detail to track progress without cluttering the board.

### 🧰 Comparing GitHub Projects to Trello & Jira

| Tool       | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Projects** | 💻 Seamless repo integration<br>🌀 Lightweight Agile support<br>✅ Simple to set up | ❌ Limited reporting<br>⚙️ Less customizable automation |
| **Trello**         | 🎨 Intuitive & drag-and-drop<br>✨ Visual power-ups<br>👥 Great for non-dev teams | ❌ Weak code integration<br>📈 No native Agile metrics       |
| **Jira**           | 📊 Robust Agile features<br>🧩 Custom workflows<br>📅 Advanced sprint tracking | ❌ Steep learning curve<br>🧱 Overkill for solo/small teams  |

Compared to **Trello**, GitHub Projects feels more developer-centric and integrated — I don’t have to leave my repo to manage tasks. Compared to **Jira**, it’s far more lightweight, which is perfect for solo development, though I do miss Jira’s reporting and deep sprint analytics at times.

For my current stage, **GitHub Projects hits the sweet spot**: it’s structured enough for Agile, flexible enough for iteration, and lives right inside my development workflow.

### 🧠 Final Thoughts

Customizing the **Team Planning** template helped me better understand my development rhythm and gave me a clean, visual way to manage my tasks. The added columns — *"Blocked"* and *"Testing"* — were small changes that made a big difference in clarity and accountability.

GitHub Projects isn’t perfect, but for solo development with an Agile mindset, it provides just enough structure to stay organized without the overhead of more complex tools. As my project grows, I can revisit Jira or Trello, but for now — this setup empowers me to build, test, and deliver with focus.

### 📚 Lessons Learned

Throughout this process, I gained several valuable insights:

- **Workflow Design Matters**: A well-structured board makes a huge difference in productivity. Simply adding "Testing" and "Blocked" helped me slow down, reflect, and avoid skipping essential steps.
- **Tooling Should Serve the Process**: It’s easy to get caught up in features, but what matters most is how the tool helps you stay focused and finish tasks.
- **Simplicity is Powerful**: I initially thought I needed something more complex, but I learned that the right level of simplicity helps me work faster and think more clearly.
- **Solo Devs Still Benefit from Agile Practices**: Applying Agile methods like iterations, WIP limits, and retrospectives—even when working alone—greatly improves project momentum and quality.
- **Customization is Key**: No template will ever be perfect, but customizing just a little can make a big difference in aligning the tool with how I think and work.

This experience not only helped me manage my project better but also made me more confident in adapting Agile tools to suit my personal development style.
