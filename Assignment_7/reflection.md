## 🎯 Reflection: Template Selection, Customization & Tool Comparison

### ⚙️ Challenges in Selecting & Customizing the Template

Choosing the right project management template wasn’t as straightforward as I expected. GitHub offers several templates — each tailored for different workflows like feature releases, bug tracking, and product launches. While they’re helpful, none felt like a perfect fit out of the box for how I wanted to manage my **Budget Tracker** project.

I eventually selected the **Team Planning** template because it supported backlogs, iterations, and task tracking — all things I needed. However, once I started building out the board, I realized some stages in my development cycle weren’t represented. 

That’s when I decided to customize the board by adding two essential columns:  
- **🧪 Testing** — for quality assurance before marking tasks as done  
- **⛔ Blocked** — to capture tasks that are paused due to blockers or dependencies  

Organizing the board into the flow:  
**`No Status → To Do → In Progress → Blocked → Testing → Done`**  
gave me a structured and visual pipeline that made more sense for both solo and Agile-based workflows. The main challenge here was balancing simplicity with process accuracy — enough detail to track progress without cluttering the board.

### 🧰 Comparing GitHub Projects to Trello & Jira

| Tool       | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Projects** | 💻 Seamless repo integration<br>🌀 Lightweight Agile support<br>✅ Simple to set up | ❌ Limited reporting<br>⚙️ Less customizable automation |
| **Trello**         | 🎨 Intuitive & drag-and-drop<br>✨ Visual power-ups<br>👥 Great for non-dev teams | ❌ Weak code integration<br>📈 No native Agile metrics       |
| **Jira**           | 📊 Robust Agile features<br>🧩 Custom workflows<br>📅 Advanced sprint tracking | ❌ Steep learning curve<br>🧱 Overkill for solo/small teams  |

Compared to **Trello**, GitHub Projects feels more developer-centric and integrated — I don’t have to leave my repo to manage tasks. Compared to **Jira**, it’s far more lightweight, which is perfect for solo development, though I do miss Jira’s reporting and deep sprint analytics at times.

For my current stage, **GitHub Projects hits the sweet spot**: it’s structured enough for Agile, flexible enough for iteration, and lives right inside my development workflow.
