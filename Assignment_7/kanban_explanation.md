### ðŸ§¾ What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban board**, to me, is a simple yet powerful way to visualize how work flows through different stages of a project. Itâ€™s made up of columns that represent the status of each task â€” usually starting from **"To Do"**, then **"In Progress"**, and finally **"Done"**. Each task is represented by a card that moves from left to right as it progresses.

What makes the Kanban board so useful is its ability to show me, at a glance, everything Iâ€™m working on, whatâ€™s coming up, and whatâ€™s already been completed. Itâ€™s like having a live dashboard for my project.

One of the most valuable aspects of using a Kanban board is that it helps me **limit how many tasks I take on at once**. This keeps me focused, avoids burnout, and increases the chances that I actually finish what I start.

Whether Iâ€™m working alone or in a team, a Kanban board keeps me organized, makes priorities clear, and creates transparency in how work is being managed. Itâ€™s not just about tracking â€” itâ€™s about **working smarter by making work visible**.
