## JUSTIFICATION FOR CHOSEN TEMPLATE

## âœ… Chosen Template: **Team Planning**

After comparing four GitHub project templates, Iâ€™ve selected **Team Planning** as the most suitable option for my **Budget Tracker** project.

### ðŸ§  Why Team Planning?

The **Team Planning** template is highly structured and aligns perfectly with Agile methodologies, especially **Scrum**. Even though Iâ€™m currently working solo, this template provides the framework needed to:

- **Organize a Product Backlog** with clear visibility on features such as transaction logging, budget alerts, balance syncing, and reporting.
- Plan **Sprints/Iterations** that allow me to break down large features into manageable tasks.
- Track **In Progress**, **Blocked**, **Review**, and **Done** stages, giving me full transparency on where each feature sits in the development lifecycle.
- Use built-in **velocity and capacity tracking**, which is helpful for evaluating my own pacing and forecasting future work as the project scales.
- Conduct **retrospectives**, which are vital for improving how I estimate tasks and reflect on sprint outcomesâ€”even as a solo dev.

### âš™ Automation Benefits

Team Planning includes:
- **Cycle planning** and deadline reminders
- **Progress insights** that auto-update based on issue status
- **Workload balance suggestions**, ensuring I donâ€™t overload myself in a sprint
- Integration with pull requests and issues for real-time updates

### ðŸ”„ Agile Alignment

This template closely mirrors a **typical Scrum board** with Backlog grooming, Sprint Planning, and Sprint Execution workflows. It supports:
- Incremental delivery of features (MVP â†’ Iteration 2 â†’ Iteration 3)
- Timeboxed development cycles
- Continuous improvement via retrospectives

### ðŸŽ¯ Why It Fits My Project

The **Budget Tracker** is an evolving system with multiple core and extended features, such as:
- Logging income/expenses
- Real-time balance updates
- Recurring transactions
- Notifications and reports
- Authentication and encryption

Managing these through structured **sprints** (e.g., Sprint 1: Core logging, Sprint 2: Budgets, Sprint 3: Reports & Security) allows me to focus on delivering value step by step, without being overwhelmed. The ability to see my work staged across phases encourages accountability and measurable progress.

### âœ… Conclusion

While templates like **Kanban** and **Roadmap** are great for visual flow and long-term planning, **Team Planning** offers the most comprehensive Agile framework. It supports **iteration-based development**, **feature prioritization**, and **capacity-aware planning**, making it the best fit for this projectâ€™s complexity and growth.
