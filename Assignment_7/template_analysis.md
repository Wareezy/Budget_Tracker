## JUSTIFICATION FOR CHOSEN TEMPLATE

## âœ… Chosen Template: Team Planning

After evaluating various GitHub templates, the **Team Planning** template stands out as the most appropriate for the **Budget Tracker** project. Its structured approach supports sprint-based workflows and detailed backlog management, which is essential for the incremental and evolving nature of this application.

### ðŸ§  Why Team Planning?

The Team Planning template provides a well-defined structure that mirrors Agile Scrum methodology. It includes columns such as `Backlog`, `Iteration`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Review`, and `Done`, which allow for clear tracking of feature development at every stage. This format enables better focus and discipline in managing tasks, ensuring that features such as income/expense logging, category management, and balance updates are completed systematically.

Even as a solo developer, adopting this template fosters accountability and encourages reflection after each iteration. It acts as a framework for planning work cycles and defining iteration goals, ensuring the most critical features are tackled first. This approach is ideal for breaking down a complex project like the Budget Tracker into smaller, manageable sprints.

### âš™ Automation Benefits

One of the key strengths of this template lies in its built-in automation for cycle management and progress tracking. As issues move across the board, their statuses update automatically, reducing manual tracking overhead. The template also includes iteration-based planning tools, which help forecast work capacity and track progress toward sprint goals.

Additionally, Team Planning can generate insights into iteration performance, highlighting trends and bottlenecks in the workflow. These insights become especially useful when reviewing completed cycles and adjusting future task estimates.

### ðŸ”„ Agile Alignment

The template aligns closely with core Agile principles such as iterative development, continuous delivery, and responsiveness to change. It supports timeboxed sprints, promotes prioritization of the most valuable work, and encourages frequent reviews through retrospectives.

This structure complements the Agile mindset of delivering working software frequently and refining it based on reflection and feedback. It provides a rhythm for development that is adaptable yet organized, supporting the growth and scalability of the project over time.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why It Fits My Project

The Budget Tracker project involves multiple modules that will be developed and improved over time. Features such as transaction logging, budget setting, category management, real-time updates, and report generation need to be carefully staged across development phases.

Team Planning allows for a phased approach where core functionalities are delivered first, followed by enhancements in future sprints. This ensures I can track and complete foundational tasks (like secure authentication or database integration) before moving on to more advanced features such as recurring transactions or financial summaries.

Furthermore, the structured planning model reduces cognitive load by clearly showing what is in progress, what is pending, and what has been completed. This visibility is crucial for maintaining momentum and avoiding burnout in a solo development environment.

---

### âœ… Conclusion

While all the templates explored offer valuable features, **Team Planning** provides the most comprehensive and Agile-aligned framework for the Budget Tracker project. Its structured columns, automation capabilities, and support for sprint planning make it ideal for managing both short-term tasks and long-term goals. By adopting this template, I can maintain focus, ensure consistent progress, and deliver a robust, user-centric application through disciplined iteration.
